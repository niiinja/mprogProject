*Eventjes provides its users with an overview of events of their favorite organizers, by scraping their websites.*

## Description

Since the Cambridge Analytica scandal, a large number of people want to leave Facebook. However, many of them feel forced to stay because they depend on it for the events and parties. They will miss one place where they can find all the upcoming events of their liked venues, because they donâ€™t want to spend a long time visiting all the individual websites. This causes people to stay on Facebook unwillingly, or to become somewhat socially isolated when they leave.

Eventjes solves this problem. Users can simply input the event pages of their favorite organizers, and the application scrapes the events from the HTML. This provides users with a handy overview of events that they might be interested in, with an additional list where they can view their favorite events that they have saved.
